body: "DrupalCamp Athens Code of Conduct\r\nDrupalCamp Athens brings together people from around the world who use, develop, design, and support the Drupal platform. Many attendees at DrupalCamp Athens are newcomers evaluating both our platform and our community.\r\nThe Drupal Code of Conduct (http://drupal.org/dcoc) outlines our shared ideals and values. This document expresses how we hope to make these ideals real at our conferences and other events. Our goal is to ensure that all participants can freely and openly share ideas in a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment that encourages and inspires mutual respect and collaboration.\r\nCome for the software, stay for the community.\r\nDrupal would simply not exist without its community. We want all attendees at DrupalCamp Athens to have an awesome experience, both in and out of formal conference sessions.\r\nThe purpose of this document is not to restrict the diversity of ideas and expression in the Drupal community; rather, it's to raise awareness of the potential for actions that could alienate valuable members — and potential members — of the community.\r\nBe considerate.\r\nDrupalCamp Athens is an international event that attracts diverse people from a wide variety of ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds. We acknowledge that cross-cultural communication can often be complicated and encourage everyone to consider both the impact of their actions on those with different backgrounds and experiences and the honest intentions of those who may have unknowingly caused offense.\r\nBe welcoming.\r\nOne of the greatest strengths of the Drupal community is our inclusiveness. Making all attendees feel welcome and included at DrupalCamp Athens is everyone’s job, including exhibitors and sponsors.\r\nBe respectful.\r\nSponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other participants should strive to treat all people with dignity and respect, regardless of their culture, religion, physical appearance, disability, race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation.\r\nBe collaborative.\r\nIf and when misunderstandings occur, we encourage people to work things out between themselves whenever possible. People are encouraged to take responsibility for their words and actions and listen to constructively-presented criticism with an open mind, courtesy, and respect.\r\nWhen we disagree, we consult others.\r\nIf people are unable to work out issues between themselves, they are encouraged to seek the advice of DrupalCamp Athens organizers.\r\nWhen we need it, we ask for help.\r\nWe do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. If you feel threatened or violated as a result of intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct, please immediately notify a conference staff member. Likewise, please immediately notify a staff member if you notice that someone else is being subjected to such behavior.\r\nThe DrupalCamp Athens team wants everyone to feel safe for the duration of the conference. If necessary, conference staff are empowered to take appropriate actions that may include, but are not limited to, warnings, expulsion from the conference without refund, and referrals to venue security or local law enforcement.\r\nWe’re all in this together\r\nThanks for making DrupalCamp Athens awesome for everyone!\r\n\r\n"
